Parking rules vary by neighborhood, so confirm ahead to avoid tickets or towing. Make sure you understand these rules before you start. Reserve your spot early and keep the unit close to your property for easy access.

### **Neighborhood Guidelines**

Many Sarasota neighborhoods have rules about mobile storage units, especially in historic districts and gated communities. These rules can include size limits, how long the container can stay, and where you can place it.

You may need approval from your neighborhood association or property management before delivery. Some areas do not allow units on the street overnight or have strict time limits, like 3 to 7 days.
