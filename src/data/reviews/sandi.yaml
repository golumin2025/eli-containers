  MI-BOX Moving & Mobile Storage's service was excellent from beginning to end. I used them to move
  cross-country. Their recommendation for local movers to pack the containers
  was great. MI-BOX Moving & Mobile Storage customer service was able to reschedule delivery multiple
  times for me. It worked out great, being able to store my items until my house
  was complete. I also had quotes from two other national brands. MI-BOX Moving & Mobile Storage had the
  best rate.
