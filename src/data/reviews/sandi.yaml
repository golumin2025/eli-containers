  PODS's service was excellent from beginning to end. I used them to move
  cross-country. Their recommendation for local movers to pack the containers
  was great. PODS customer service was able to reschedule delivery multiple
  times for me. It worked out great, being able to store my items until my house
  was complete. I also had quotes from two other national brands. PODS had the
  best rate.
