  MI-Box of Vermont is a great company! They were very accommodating with the
  schedule, the drivers were highly skilled and able to maneuver the 8x16 ft MI
  Box I had in and out of my difficult driveway. Ashleigh, from the office was a
  great communicator and kept me well informed throughout the process. I 100%
  recommend MI-Box!
