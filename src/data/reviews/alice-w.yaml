  I would highly recommend using MI-BOX Moving & Mobile Storage for local and cross-country moving and
  storage. I used MI-BOX Moving & Mobile Storage to store my belongings and then move them across four
  states. Everything arrived in one piece and exactly as packed. From the person
  I booked everything with on the phone to the delivery driver to the person who
  picked up the empty container, everyone was lovely and incredibly
  professional. I will use MI-BOX Moving & Mobile Storage for any future moving needs.
