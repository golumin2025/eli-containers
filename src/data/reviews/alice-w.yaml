  I would highly recommend using PODS for local and cross-country moving and
  storage. I used PODS to store my belongings and then move them across four
  states. Everything arrived in one piece and exactly as packed. From the person
  I booked everything with on the phone to the delivery driver to the person who
  picked up the empty container, everyone was lovely and incredibly
  professional. I will use PODS for any future moving needs.
