  My experience with MI-Box of Vermont was exceptional in every way.  They were
  very responsive and kept in communication with me while I made a difficult
  move from my long-time home in

  VT to a new home in MA.  Everything went smoothly from delivery to pickup. 
  The driver was very conscious of setting the box so that it was more easily
  accessible and leveled.  He was very polite and professional.  The pick up
  went without a hitch.

  I was able to get the right size box for my immediate needs with the help of
  the lovely woman in the office.  The box was clean and in good condition.

  I highly recommend them!
