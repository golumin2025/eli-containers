  Great move again, second time around! Kevin G. was on time, called when
  getting close, put the box right where it was needed (with precision!). Pick
  up was the same; great communication from office and driver (Kevin G. again)
  and contents were in perfect shape, a testament to the care taken driving the
  6-7 hours and my packing :-)... Would use a third time if needed. Great
  service and good, secure, weathertight container.
