  Very easy to set up. Great price for not having to drive your stuff across
  town or another state. MI-BOX Moving & Mobile Storage was excellent helping set up the move and changing
  dates around. It's also nice not having to balance the load inside the
  container, the way they pick it up. The website is easy to use as well,
  checking the status of the deliveries or pick-ups and changing dates.
