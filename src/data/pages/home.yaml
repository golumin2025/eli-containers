        They were friendly and informative on the phone and offered excellent
        customer service. Nick was our driver for both drop off and pick up and
        he couldn't have been nicer. He explained everything clearly, was
        professional and on time in both directions. We felt as though we got
        excellent value for our money and just what we needed. We would not
        hesitate to be repeat customers if we need similar storage again.

        Because of the unique capabilities of the MI-BOX Level-Lift system, we
        can place a mobile storage container where you need it and do that
        better than anyone else in the portable storage industry.&nbsp;

        Megan was friendly, responsive, and super helpful from start to finish.
        Each of our drivers, Steve, Nick, and Seth were very communicative,
        friendly, and professional. We have moved quite a few times throughout
        the US and this was by far the greatest experience we have had.
