        - question: How do Billing & Payments Work with PODS?
          answer: >
            **No deposits, no obligations:** Like most hotel reservations, you
            can reserve your PODS container with a credit card – no payments are
            due until 7 days before your container delivery.


            **Easy cancellation:** If you change your dates or change your mind,
            it's no worries! Visit pods.com/cancel to view our full cancellation
            policy.


            **No surprise costs:** We're transparent with our pricing in your
            detailed quote, which you'll receive via email.


            **Avoid late fees:** Your containers are rented by the month, so you
            can take your time loading and unloading – without worrying about
            extra fees that can come with a truck rental.


            **Flexible scheduling:** With PODS there are no rigid schedules. If
            your plans change you can login to my.pods.com to update your
            schedule.
        - question: How long do I have to load or unload my PODS container?
          answer: >
            Take your time - your PODS container rental is monthly, giving you
            the flexibility to pack and unload at your own pace. Your 30-day
            billing cycle starts when we deliver your container.
