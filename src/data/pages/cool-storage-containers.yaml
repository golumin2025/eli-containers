        When we deliver our&nbsp; Ice Cold Storage trailer, we work with you in
        positioning it in the most efficient working location. Then we lock down
        the trailer with a Hitch Lock and wheel lock for security. We will
        stabilize the Ice Cold Storage Trailer with leveling jacks, secure the
        tires with wheel chocks, and provide you with locks for the doors to
        secure your product. It will also come with a hitch pin, and 25′ 110V
        power cord.
