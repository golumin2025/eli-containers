        ​This document sets out the policies of MI-BOX regarding the protection
        of the rights of persons to privacy. Its purpose is to explain to
        contacts and all others who deal with MI-BOX what types of personal
        information MI-BOX collects and how that information is used.&nbsp;


        This policy reflects no commitment by, nor is it binding upon any party
        or parties other than MI-BOX.


        At &nbsp;times, MI-BOX collects certain personal information about
        &nbsp;people with whom it deals, either in their personal capacities or
        as representatives of client institutions, suppliers or other
        businesses. Such people are referred to in this policy as “MI-BOX’
        contacts” or as simply as “contacts”.


        MI-BOX collects identifiable personal data as well as non-identifiable
        personal information. Items of identifiable &nbsp;personal information,
        such as names and contact details, are collected &nbsp;and used as a
        matter of course in MI-BOX’ daily work. Often a person’s identifiable
        personal information includes the role or roles the person plays on
        behalf of his or her employer in the employer’s business relationship
        with MI-BOX.

        undertakes to use personal information solely for the purposes described
        above, and will not otherwise, unless legally obliged to do so, provide

        security measures. In addition to normal precautions such as physical
        security and software/hardwarefirewalls, we have and adhere to strict
        internal security policies.

        MI-BOX reserves the right to disclose personal information in its
        possession where it is required to do so by law or to exercise its legal
        rights or to defend itself against legal claims.


        ​MI-BOX reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy. Where
        a major change is made, contacts will be informed by e-mail notification
        or through a notice on our website. Contacts bear the responsibility to
        read the changes.

        w-fit pb-2.5">​Collection of Personal Data</h1> </div>


        ​MI-BOX collects personal data about contacts. Contacts include those
        employees of client institutions with whom MI-BOX will deal in the
        normal course of business. This information is collected when
        institutions first procure services from, or enter into a service
        agreement with MI-BOX, when they instruct MI-BOX, as their provider or
        Agent, to provide services or undertake service procurement or other
        actions on their behalf. Contacts also include persons within supplier
        and other organizations with which MI-BOX has a business relationship –
        i.e. persons that suppliers, including self-employed consultants and
        contractors, or other organizations such as government departments or
        statutory bodies have appointed to deal with MI-BOX.


        MI-BOX does not collect personal information about end users of client
        institution’s networks.

        ​MI-BOX uses personal information to ensure effective business
        communications with contact persons and/or client institutions,
        suppliers and other organizations with which MI-BOX has dealings.


        &nbsp;In its capacity as the agent of client institutions, MI-BOX
        provides personal information about contact persons of client
        institutions to suppliers, where the supplier needs to use this
        information to communicate directly with the client institution.
        Similarly, MI-BOX provides contact details of suppliers’ personnel to
        client institutions where this is needed for the furtherance of the
        business relationship.


        The MI-BOX may collect other types of anonymous data from website users
        through the use of “cookies,” which are text files that a website places
        on the hard drive of your computer indicating what pages you visited.
        When you return to the website, your browser sends that information back
        to the site. MI-BOX may use the information provided by cookies to
        analyze trends, administer the site, or for research and marketing
        purposes
